## 2. Optimal Work Patterns

### Best Working Hours
| Time Block | Energy Level | Best For |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| 7:00-14:00 | HIGH | Deep work, complex tasks, meetings |
| 14:00-19:00 | LOW | Light tasks, admin, breaks |
| 19:00-20:00 | MEDIUM | Second wind, meetings possible |
| 23:00-01:00 | MEDIUM | Creative work (if not tired) |

### Deep Work Capacity
- **Weekly capacity: 6-10 hours of true deep work**
- PROTECT THESE HOURS. They are finite and precious.
- After 3-4 hours focus declines significantly
- After 6 hours, typically not productive

### Energy Management
- Morning = highest cognitive capacity (use for important work)
- Early afternoon = energy dip (schedule breaks, light tasks)
- Evening = potential second wind (use for creative, less demanding work)
- Likes working in cafes in the morning
