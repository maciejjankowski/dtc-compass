# nSENS Cognitive Bias Catalog
# For Claude to read and apply during decision analysis

# CRITICAL: nSENS Protocol for Claude
protocol:
  observability:
    - "ALWAYS log detected biases using log_decision tool"
    - "Include: bias_name, evidence (exact text that triggered), confidence, context"
    - "Log even when no biases detected (for calibration)"

  memory_preservation:
    - "Before analyzing, search_decisions for similar past decisions"
    - "Reference relevant past decisions in current analysis"
    - "Store insights for future retrieval"

  self_improvement:
    - "Track which biases you detect vs miss (via user feedback)"
    - "Note patterns: which biases appear together"
    - "Adjust confidence based on past accuracy"

usage: |
  When analyzing a decision, Claude MUST:
  1. search_decisions for similar past decisions (memory)
  2. Read this catalog and check reasoning against relevant biases
  3. Report detected biases with evidence
  4. log_decision with all findings (observability)
  5. Note any patterns for future improvement (self-improvement)
