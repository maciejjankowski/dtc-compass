# USAGE WORKFLOW

workflow:
  discovery_call:
    sequence:
      1. strategic_context (always first)
      2. Choose 1-2 from: market_analysis, technology_assessment, roi_validation
      3. failure_modes (always last for premortem)

    output: "client/{name}/discovery_YYYY_MM_DD.md"

  deep_dive:
    sequence:
      1. One focused topic (60-90 min deep dive)
      2. Validate assumptions with Curie persona
      3. Quantify ROI with Midas persona

    output: "client/{name}/deep_dive_{topic}_YYYY_MM_DD.md"

  continuous:
    frequency: "Every major decision point"
    topics: ["failure_modes", "roi_validation"]
    purpose: "Continuous validation and risk assessment"
